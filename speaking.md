I'm enthusiastic about the free exchange of information and enjoy every opportunity to share my knowledge and teach others what I love and am passionate about doing: Rapid Application Development (RAD) of internet applications using JavaScript and AngularJS. If you would like me to speak at your event or to hold a workshop, please reach out.
