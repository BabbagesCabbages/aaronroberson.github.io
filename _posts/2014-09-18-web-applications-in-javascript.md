In this course we'll be covering the core concepts for building functional web applications using the MEAN stack: [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), [Express.js](http://epxressjs.com), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

##Course Description

We are going to spend the first few classes learning noSQL database concepts and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com). We'll install and run MongoDB on our local machines and will cover the following:

1. Shell commands
2. Database methods
3. Collection methods including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
4. MongoDB Utilities

Next, we'll spend a few classes on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Express.js](http://epxressjs.com) learning the following concepts:

1. Server-side routing
2. RESTful APIs using the [Mongoose ODM](http://mongoosejs.com) middleware library
3. OAuth (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) and email/password authentication using [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org)
4. Role-based security. 
5. [Stripe](http://stripe.com) integration (customer, billing and order history)

The remaining portion of the class will be spent learning and using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) MVC/MVVM framework to:

1. Perform client-side routing
2. Client-side, role-based authentication
3. Create a user profile module where users will be able to manage their account profile including their billing and shipping addresses, credit card information and order history.
4. Create an admin module where application admins will be able to manage site users, orders and products (adding, updating and deleting products).

Finally, we'll deploy our application to the cloud using a PaaS (Platform as a Service) solution such as [OpenShift](http://openshift.com), [Heroku](http://heroku.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) or the service of your choice.

##Pre-requisites

Here are what I would consider to be the basic pre-requisites:

1. Good understanding of HTML and CSS
2. Working understanding of the DOM (Document Object Model)
3. Basic programming concepts (data types, syntax, data structures, control structures, and control flow)
4. Beginning to intermediate JavaScript
5. Familiarity with AngularJS

Great to have but not required:

1. Familiarity with MVC/MVVM design pattern/frameworks
2. JavaScript debugging
3. Familiarity with source control (Git/SVN)

Below are some resources for a basic understanding of the aforementioned concepts, languages and frameworks:
